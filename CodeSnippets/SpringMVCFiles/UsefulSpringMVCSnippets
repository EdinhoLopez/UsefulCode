//You are able to get parameters from a JPS page in SpringMVC by using the @RequestParam annotation. In your JSP form remember to call this 
//method when the form is submitted. Then you need to make sure the name of the String variable (i.e. String username) is the same as the
//name given to the input in the JPS page.

@RequestMapping("/verifyUser")
	public String loginUser(@RequestParam String username, @RequestParam String password) {
		
		System.out.println("name: " + username + " password: " + password);
		
		return "Welcome";
	}
