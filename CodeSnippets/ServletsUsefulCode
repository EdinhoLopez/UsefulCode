//You are able to use cookies in order to keep track of values between JSPs and Servlets
//Defining and adding a cookie object to the response object of the servlet

Cookie testCookie = new Cookie("favoriteCookie","NewCookie");

//You are able to then retrieve the value of the cookie through the JSP
//Use expression language to access the implicit cookie object

<h1>Here is the Cookie value: ${cookie.favoriteCookie.value }</h1>

//Remember that you are able to access the cookie object from any JSP thus having a scope similar to session
